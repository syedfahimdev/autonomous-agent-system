# ðŸš€ Quick Fly.io Deployment Fix

## Current Issue
The deployment is failing due to health check timeouts. This guide will fix the issue.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Update Configuration
The `fly.toml` and `Dockerfile.fly` have been updated with:
- âœ… Longer health check timeouts
- âœ… Better startup script
- âœ… More lenient grace periods

### 2. Redeploy
```bash
# Deploy with the updated configuration
fly deploy

# If it still fails, try rebuilding
fly deploy --build-only
```

### 3. Check Logs
```bash
# View deployment logs
fly logs

# Check app status
fly status
```

### 4. Test Deployment
```bash
# Test your deployment
python test_deployment.py https://your-app-name.fly.dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Health Checks Still Fail:

1. **Check if app is starting:**
   ```bash
   fly logs --follow
   ```

2. **SSH into the container:**
   ```bash
   fly ssh console
   ```

3. **Test health endpoint manually:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
   ```

4. **Check environment variables:**
   ```bash
   fly secrets list
   ```

### Common Issues:

1. **Missing OpenAI API Key:**
   ```bash
   fly secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
   ```

2. **Memory issues:**
   ```bash
   fly scale memory 2048
   ```

3. **App not starting:**
   ```bash
   fly apps restart your-app-name
   ```

## Configuration Changes Made:

### Dockerfile.fly
- âœ… Added startup script
- âœ… Longer health check timeouts (120s start period)
- âœ… Better error handling

### fly.toml
- âœ… Increased grace period to 30s
- âœ… Increased health check interval to 60s
- âœ… Increased timeout to 10s

### start.sh
- âœ… Proper directory creation
- âœ… Environment variable checks
- âœ… Better startup logging

## Test Your Deployment

After deployment, test with:
```bash
python test_deployment.py https://your-app-name.fly.dev
```

This will verify:
- âœ… Health endpoint is working
- âœ… Main application is accessible
- âœ… All services are running
